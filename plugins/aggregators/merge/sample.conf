# Merge metrics into multifield metrics by series key
[[aggregators.merge]]
  ## Precision to round the metric timestamp to
  ## This is useful for cases where metrics to merge arrive within a small
  ## interval and thus vary in timestamp. The timestamp of the resulting metric
  ## is also rounded.
  # round_timestamp_to = "1ns"

  ## The period on which to flush & clear each aggregator. 
  ## All metrics that are sent with timestamps outside of this period will be ignored by the aggregator.
  # period = "30s"

  ## The delay before each aggregator is flushed. 
  ## This is to control how long for aggregators to wait before receiving metrics from input plugins, 
  ## in the case that aggregators are flushing and inputs are gathering on the same interval.
  # delay = "100ms"

  ## The duration when the metrics will still be aggregated by the plugin, 
  ## even though they're outside of the aggregation period. 
  ## This is needed in a situation when the agent is expected to receive late metrics 
  ## and it's acceptable to roll them up into next aggregation period.  
  # grace = "0s"

  ## If true, the original metric will be dropped by the
  ## aggregator and will not get sent to the output plugins.
  drop_original = true
